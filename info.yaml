# TinyTapeout project information
#
# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "LAB11"
  description:  "Cycles through the characters of LAB11"
  how_it_works: "Gates & flip-flops connected to the 7-segment display change the state of corresponding LED segments to form the next character, each cycle"
  how_to_test:  "Set to desired clock speed â€“ characters are most readable at the lowest speed"
  external_hw:  "None"
